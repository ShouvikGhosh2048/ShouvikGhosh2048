### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Shouvik. I'm interested in learning about Maths, Computer Science and Programming and making projects.

I'm also interested in working on projects with others. Feel free to send me an email at shouvikg.cal@gmail.com if you want to work together.

Some of my projects:
- [3D crossword](https://github.com/ShouvikGhosh2048/3d-crossword) - A website to create and solve 3D crosswords. Built with Typescript, React and React Three Fiber.
- [Who's that Cassette Beast](https://github.com/ShouvikGhosh2048/whos-that-cassette-beast) - A game where you guess the Cassette Beast from it's silhouette. Built with Typescript and React (Next.js).
- [Correlation experiment](https://github.com/ShouvikGhosh2048/correlation-experiment) - A website for guessing correlation. The goal is to see how people are at guessing correlations. Built with Typescript and React (Next.js).
